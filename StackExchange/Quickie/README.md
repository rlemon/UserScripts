##Quickie
- Still in VERY early stages right now. 
- Looking for alpha testers to dabble around with it and report any bugs to me :D *please*

Install the script [here](https://github.com/rlemon/UserScripts/raw/master/StackExchange/Quickie/quickie.user.js)

The menu will appear on the bottom right of your screen *default is closed*.

Clicking on the 'Quickie Handle' will open the menu and display ten questions according to your selected options.
